# LinkedList

This is a school project using Java to implement a doubly linked list created out of nodes, 
which reads from a list of states and implements a sort, a delete, and an add function. I am
not using a built in linked list class from Java, but creating one from scratch for this project.
Also, part of the project required I also create a stack, which i did also using nodes.
